# How to Use

## Prerequisites

Node.js: Download from nodejs.org
MySQL: This project uses a MySQL database hosted on DigitalOcean.

Database CA Certificate:
To securely connect to the DigitalOcean database, a CA certificate file is required. Ensure the certificate file is located in the designated folder within your project so that the database connection uses it securely.

### Ngrok

Ngrok for Remote Access
This project uses Ngrok to securely expose the local server to the internet. Ngrok is particularly helpful for testing features that require external access, such as scanning the QR code on a label with a mobile device to render its contents.

Install Ngrok: Download and install Ngrok from ngrok.com.

Start Ngrok: Run the following command to create a tunnel for your application (assuming it runs on port 3000): ngrok http 3000

Update URLs: Once Ngrok is running, it will provide a forwarding link (e.g., https://example.ngrok-free.app).

Replace any existing Ngrok links in the code with the new link. To update the links, do a project-wide search for "ngrok" and replace the URLs as needed.

### Environment Setup

Create a .env file in the root directory of your project with the following configuration to set up database connections and application settings:

Email configuration:

EMAIL_USER=your_email_address

EMAIL_PASS=your_email_password

Application base URL:

BASE_URL=your_base_url

Database configuration:

DB_HOST=your_database_host

DB_USER=your_database_user

DB_PASSWORD=your_database_password

DB_DATABASE=your_database_name

DB_PORT=your_database_port

### Install Dependencies

After creating the .env file, run the following command in the project directory to install the necessary packages: npm install

## Run

To start the server, open the terminal in the root directory and run: node index.js
